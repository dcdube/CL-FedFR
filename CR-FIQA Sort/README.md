# Sorting images using CR-FIQA scores
This section explains how the Certainty Ratio Face Image Quality Assessment **(CR-FIQA)** scores were used as a curriculum to sort the [MS-Celeb-1M](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-46487-9_6) images from "easy" to "difficult". To understand the **CR-FIQA** algorithm and how it is implemented, read the paper below and follow the steps in the repository below.

## Overview

We propose a two-stage curriculum learning strategy based on **CR-FIQA** scores. The training begins with high-quality (easy) images and progressively incorporates more difficult samples.

### Key Components

- **CR-FIQA Framework**: Used to estimate the **Face Image Quality (FIQ)** of each sample. This framework learns to predict the **relative classifiability** of images.
- **Image Sorting**: Samples are scored using CR-FIQA and sorted in **descending order** based on quality.  
  - **High scores** â†’ Easy-to-classify images  
  - **Low scores** â†’ Hard-to-classify images

### Training Strategy

The sorted images are then fed to the [FedFR](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/20057) algorithm in the following stages:

- **Stage 1**: Train on the **top 50%** of images (those with the highest CR-FIQA scores).
- **Stage 2**: Use the model parameters from Stage 1 as initialization and train on **all** images.

## Overview

We propose a two-stage curriculum learning strategy based on **CR-FIQA** scores. Training begins with high-quality (easy) images and gradually incorporates more difficult samples.

## Key Components

- **CR-FIQA Framework**: Estimates the **Face Image Quality (FIQ)** of each sample by learning to predict the **relative classifiability** of images.
- **Image Sorting**: Each image is scored using CR-FIQA and sorted in **descending order** based on quality.

## Training Strategy

The sorted images are then used to train the [FedFR](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/20057) algorithm in two stages:

- **Stage 1**: Train on the **top 50%** of images (those with the highest CR-FIQA scores).
- **Stage 2**: Initialize the model with parameters from Stage 1 and continue training on **all** images.
