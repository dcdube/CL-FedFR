# Curriculum Learning for Federated Face Recognition

This work proposes a federated FR framework that uses curriculum learning to sort the images from “easy” to “difficult” during training. Two distinct curricula are considered: Face image quality assessment (FIQA) scores and head rotation. The performance of these curriculum designs is assessed both for fully-supervised and semi-supervised federated face recognition setups.
