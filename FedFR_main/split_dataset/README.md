# Split MS1M dataset to our Federated Learning (FL) dataset

The original MS1M-Arcface [1,2] contains 85k IDs.
We split it into two parts. The first half (42k IDs) are used to generate the FL dataset. The other half (42k IDs) are used to generate pretrained dataset. 

## Prerequisite
You should first download the ms1m dataset from [[here]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SXS4-Am3bsKSK615qbYdbA_FMVh3sAvR/view).

The argument `--data_dir` in the following codes (split_FL.py & split_pretrain.py) is the path to `<PATH/TO/face_emore>`.

## Generate FL dataset
Run the `split_FL.py` to generate dataset.
The meaning of the arguments are as follow:
- **`data_dir`** : The path to folder "face_emore". eg. "/home/jackieliu/faces_ms1m-refine-v2_112x112/face_emore"
- **`output_dir`** : Your desired path. eg. "/home/jackieliu/face_recognition/ms1m_split/"
- **`num_client`** : The number of clients in the federated framework. eg. 40 in our work.
- **`num_ID`** : The number of total ID in the federated framework. eg. 4000 in our work.

In our work, we choose 4000 IDs from the first 42k IDs. We split it into 40 clients and each client contains 100 IDs.
We run it as follows:
```
python3 split_FL.py --data_dir <path/to/face_emore> --output_dir </home/jackieliu/face_recognition/ms1m_split> --num_ID 4000 --num_client 40
```
## Generate Pretrained dataset
Run the `split_pretrain.py` to generate dataset.
The meaning of the arguments are as follow:
- **`data_dir`** : The path to folder "face_emore". eg. "/home/jackieliu/faces_ms1m-refine-v2_112x112/face_emore"
- **`output_dir`** : Your desired path. eg. "/home/jackieliu/face_recognition/ms1m_split/"
- **`num_client`** : Because there is only one client, we set 1 here.
- **`num_ID`** : The number of total ID in the pretrained dataset eg. 6000 in our work.

In our work, we choose 6000 IDs from the other half 42k IDs.
We run it as follows:
```
python3 split_pretrain.py --data_dir <path/to/face_emore> --output_dir </home/jackieliu/face_recognition/ms1m_split> --num_ID 6000 --num_client 1
```
